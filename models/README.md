# Models

- The models/ directory is where you save your trained neural network models.
- When you train your model, youâ€™ll save checkpoints (model weights) here.
- Consider organizing subdirectories for different model architectures or experiments (e.g., models/resnet18, models/unet, etc.)

> [!CAUTION]
> Same as data/ directory. Do not push nor commit any trained model file here. Only for configuration/directories purposes.
